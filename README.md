# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction
In this project, I use supervised learning models to identify customers who are likely to churn in the future. The objective of this project is to help banks identify customers who are at risk of leaving, so that they can take proactive measures to retain them. Furthermore, I analyze top factors that influence user retention.
